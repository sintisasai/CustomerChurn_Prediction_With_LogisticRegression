Customer Churn is a burning problem for many companies, largely including Telcom Companies. This project involves a simulation of one such case of customer churn where on a data of postpaid customers with a contract was worked on. The dataset (“Cellphone.xlsx”) has information about customer usage behavior, contract details, and payment details. The data also indicates the customers who canceled their service (“churn = 1”). Based on this past data, I built a model which predicts whether a customer will cancel their service in the future or not. The following task were accompanished

Explorartory Data analysis, 
Multicollinearity check, 
Spliting the data into train set (80%) and test set (20%), 
Logistic Regression Model building - selection of the best model with train set, 
Comparing the models performances using confusion matrix and other evaluation measures.
